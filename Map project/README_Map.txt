***Map Project*** This project represent the map of some important monuments all over the world. 
We use Geopy and Basemap library to represent it on the map. When pragram starts it shows the map with monuments
from the Excel base.Then user is allowed to insert hisown monuments. User input the name of the monument, the city or/and
state (ex. in the form: Paris, France) and the size of moument area. User can input multiple monuments
Program asks the user if he finish inputing. The user can chose 'd' for yes or 'n' for not.
 When finishes inputing new monuments, the updated map is shown. Monuments are represented with spots according to its area size.
 The program is made in Spyder with Automatic Backend.
